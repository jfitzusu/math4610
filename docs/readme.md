## Top Five Pages

I'd actually been keeping up with this throughout the semester. However, since you decided you only wanted to see our top five pages, I decided not to include them for later assignments. Honestly, they're all about the same quality, so you could look at just about any of them. The operations ones might be a little funky just due to the massive quantity affecting quality. 

I guess my top five are probably my root finding docs. There's six of them so you can just choose whatever. You can find them all [here](/rootfinding/index.md).
